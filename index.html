  <h1>Hi, Priyadarshini Vasudevan!</h1>

    <p>Hi,</p>

    <p>Never thought Id be writing one, but I felt like this was needed (reason end la irukku, but dont jump to that :p)
    First up, Im sorry. Im sorry for trying to play around with you in the beginning. 
    Out of all the girls I have spoken to, I NEVER imagined that Id be so emotionally attached to one and that I wouldnt be able to talk to a different girl without having you cross my mind. 
    In short, the past 6 months has been a fairytale, a very beautiful chapter, something I never saw coming and something I will never forget and regret. They say stuff happens when its least expected, ngl, someone like me who hass always found these things cringy, you showed me that its not the case.
    </p>
    <p>From Priyadarshini Vasudevan to PD, from some long name that used to appear on my screen to someone whom i cant stop talking to, it has been a wonderful journey.</p>
    <p>
    You? You will always be my happy place, my white flag, someone I will think about when i am feeling low, someone I look up to, my first ever girl thats made me feel so different about so many things, my first ever <a href = "https://youtu.be/My_S68DAAPg"><b>Aval</b></a>. I will always want the best for you, will always be there for you, you deserve the best for who you are and how you have been to me. 
    </p>
    <p>
    I never thought Id shed a tear and be smiling at the same time seeing <i>Priya Garden</i> while driving back, but hey, something new and it is you. (reason for me writing this, as mentioned in the beginning) 
    </p>
    <p>
    Okkkk Im done but one last thing, however things go from hereon, just wanna let you know you were worth it all, you were worth falling for, you wrote this beautiful chapter in my life id carry forever.
    </p>
    <p>
    All the best for your new journey. You are a strong woman and I know for a fact you are going to have the best time of your life.
    </p>
    <p>
    I will miss you sooo much.
    </p>
    <p>With lots of love, always your 5yr old<br>
    Ram</p>
